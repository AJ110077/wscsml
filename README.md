## Web Services Classification using Supervised Machine Learning

wscsml is an ongoing project written in Python 3 with the aim of improving the classification of Web Services.
It aims to extend the research conducted by Heyam H. Al-Baity and Norah I. AlShowiman.

PyCharm Community Edition is used as the IDE in combination with a conda virtual environment.

### Setting up the development environment
1. Install PyCharm Community Edition IDE and Anaconda on your desktop.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Inside the project directory, import the existing conda project from the `requirements.txt` using the following command
    
    ```conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt```
    
    where `<env>` is the name of the virtual environment that you want to create.
